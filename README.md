## Project Summary:
Developed a web application leveraging AWS services that enables users to sign up, log in, and engage in real-time chat with other users. The project showcases proficiency in AWS cloud services, front-end development, and security implementations.

## Key Features:
* **Real-time Chat:** Users can sign up and log in to engage in real-time chat conversations with other users.

* **AWS S3 Integration:** Utilized AWS S3 for efficient delivery of static resources such as JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap(CSS) to enhance the web application's performance. <br>
&nbsp;
* **Lambda Functions:** Employed AWS Lambda for cloud data manipulation, enabling seamless interactions between users in the chat. <br>
&nbsp;
* **DynamoDB Integration:** Implemented AWS DynamoDB to store and manage chat data, ensuring scalability and data persistence. <br>
&nbsp;
* **API Gateway:** Utilized AWS API Gateway to model REST APIs and SDK, facilitating communication between the front-end and back-end components. <br>
&nbsp;
* **Secure User Login:** Integrated AWS Cognito to provide secure user authentication and login functionality. <br>
&nbsp;
* **Access Management:** Demonstrated proficiency in managing permissions and access policies using AWS IAM services. <br>
&nbsp;
* **CloudFront Acceleration:** Utilized AWS CloudFront to accelerate web app performance, ensuring a smooth user experience even with large-scale usage. <br>
&nbsp;
* **Dynamic User Pages:** Implemented dynamic user pages to provide a personalized experience for each user. <br>
&nbsp;
* **Client-Side Security:** Ensured client-side security management with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to mitigate potential security risks. <br>
