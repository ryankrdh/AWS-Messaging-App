## Project Summary:
Developed a web application leveraging AWS services that enables users to sign up, log in, and engage in real-time chat with other users. The project showcases proficiency in AWS cloud services, front-end development, and security implementations.

## Key Features:
* Engineered and deployed a full-stack chat conversation data manager on AWS with Amazon S3 for persistence. Delivery of static contents is accelerated by CloudFront CDN and secured in client-side access control with CORS.

* Implemented a user management system and sign-in functionalities with Cognito and incorporated IAM to enable secure user registration and managed account permissions. 

* Developed RESTful APIs in Amazon API Gateway to enable GET/POST functionality that uses Lambda functions in the cloud to manipulate data at scale using DynamoDB with CRUD operations.
