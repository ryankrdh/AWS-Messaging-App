## Key Features

**Static Resource Serving:** Static resources including JavaScript, HTML, and BOOTSTRAP(CSS) files are efficiently served to web browsers using AWS's S3, ensuring optimal performance.

**Dynamic Chat App:** JavaScript is utilized to dynamically modify the chat application, enabling real-time updates and enhancing the interactivity for users.

**Access Policy Management:** Permissions and access policies are effectively managed using AWS IAM, ensuring secure and controlled access to the application's resources.

**Cloud-based Data Manipulation:** AWS Lambda enables efficient manipulation and processing of data in the cloud, ensuring scalability and seamless data management.

**Client-side Security Management:** CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is employed to manage client-side security, allowing controlled and secure communication between the web app and external resources.

**Chat Data Storage:** Chat data is securely stored and retrieved using DynamoDB, an efficient NoSQL database service provided by AWS.

**API Modeling and SDK Creation:** APIs are elegantly modeled and software development kits (SDKs) are created using API Gateway, simplifying integration and interaction with the application's services.

**User Login System:** A user-friendly login system is implemented using AWS Cognito, ensuring secure authentication and authorization for application users.

**Accelerated Web App Performance:** The web app's performance is optimized with the help of CloudFront CDN (Content Delivery Network), resulting in faster content delivery and an improved user experience.
